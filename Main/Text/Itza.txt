Chichen Itza was a large pre-Columbian city
built by the Maya people of the Termina
l Classic period. 
The archeological site
 is located in Tinum Municipality, Yucata
n State, Mexico.

Chichen Itza was a major focal point in th
e Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Cl
assic (600-900) through the Terminal Cl
assic (800-900) and into the early port
ion of the Postclassic period (900-1200
). 
The site exhibits a multitude of arch
itectural styles, reminiscent of styles s
een in central Mexico and of the Puuc and
 Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowla
nds. 
The presence of central Mexican sty
les was once thought to have been represe
ntative of direct migration or even conqu
est from central Mexico, but most contemp
orary interpretations view the presence o
f these non-Maya styles more as the resul
t of cultural diffusion.

Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya c
ities and it was likely to have been one 
of the mythical great cities, or Tollans,
 referred to in later Mesoamerican litera
ture. 
The city may have had the most div
erse population in the Maya world, a fact
or that could have contributed to the var
iety of architectural styles at the site.


The ruins of Chichen Itza are federal prop
erty, and the site's stewardship is maint
ained by Mexico's Instituto Nacional de A
ntropologia e Historia (National Institu
te of Anthropology and History). 
It is o
ne of the most visited archeological site
s in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourist
s in 2017.
