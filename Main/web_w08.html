                The Giza pyramid complex (also called the 
                Giza necropolis) is the site on the Giza 
                Plateau in Greater Cairo, Egypt that includes
                the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Pyramid
                of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure,
                along with the Great Sphinx of Giza. 
                All were built during the Fourth Dynasty of
                the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, between
                2600 and 2500 BC.
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;
                The site is at the edges of the Western 
                Desert, approximately 9 kilometres west of 
                the Nile River in the city of Giza.

                The Great Pyramid and the Pyramid of Khafre
                are the largest pyramids built in 
                ancient Egypt, and they have historically been
                common as emblems of Ancient Egypt in 
                the Western imagination. 
                It is by far the 
                oldest of the Ancient Wonders and the 
                only one still in existence.

            <p>
                &emsp;
                The Giza pyramid complex consists of the G
                reat Pyramid (also known as the Pyramid 
                of Cheops), the somewhat smaller Pyramid 
                of Khafre (or Chephren), and the 
                relatively modest-sized Pyramid of Menkaure (or 
                Mykerinos). 
                The Great Sphinx lies on the east side of the complex.
                Along with these major monuments are a 
                number of smaller satellite edifices, known
                as "queens" pyramids, causeways and valley
                pyramids.

                The pyramids of Giza and others are 
                thought to have been constructed to house the 
                remains of the deceased pharaohs who ruled
                over Ancient Egypt. 
                A portion of the pharaoh's spirit was believed to remain 
                with his corpse.

                Most construction theories are based on the 
                idea that the pyramids were built by 
                moving huge stones from a quarry and 
                dragging and lifting them into place. 
                Disagreements arise over the feasibility of the
                different proposed methods by which the 
                stones were conveyed and placed.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                &emsp;
                In building the pyramids, the architects
                might have developed their techniques over time. 
                They would select a site on a relatively
                flat area of bedrock, which provided a stable foundation. 
                After carefully surveying the site and laying
                down the first level of stones, they 
                constructed the pyramids in horizontal 
                levels, one on top of the other.
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;
                To ensure that the pyramid remained 
                symmetrical, the exterior casing stones all had
                to be equal in height and width.
                Workers might have marked all the blocks to 
                indicate the angle of the pyramid wall and 
                trimmed the surfaces carefully so that the
                blocks fit together.
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;
                The site was inscribed on the UNESCO World
                Heritage List in 1979. 
                The Great Pyramid of Giza, largest and oldest of the three
                pyramids at the Giza Necropolis was 
                granted honorary status in the New 7 Wonders
                of the World list.
