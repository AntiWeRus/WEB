                Christ the Redeemer is an Art Deco statue 
                of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro. 
                Statue was created by French sculptor Paul Lan
                dowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor 
                da Silva Costa, in collaboration with 
                French engineer Albert Caquot and Romanian
                sculptor Gheorghe Leonida, who fashioned 
                the face.
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;
                The statue was onstructed between 1922 and 1931. 
                It is made of reinforced concrete
                and soapstone. The monument weighs 635 metric ton.
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;
                Maintenance work needs to be conducted 
                periodically because of the strong winds and
                erosion to which the statue is exposed, 
                as well as lightning strikes.                
                The original pale stone is no longer available in 
                sufficient quantity, and replacement
                stones are increasingly darker in hue.

                &emsp;
                The Christ the Redeemer differs 
                considerably from its original design. 
                The initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in 
                one hand and a cross in the other. 
                Although the project organisers originally 
                accepted the design, it later changed to the
                statue of today, with the arms spread out wide.
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;
                It is a symbol of Christianity around the 
                world, the statue has also become a 
                cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and 
                Brazil and was voted one of the New Seven 
                Wonders of the World.
