                Petra is a historic and archaeological city
                in southern Jordan. 
                The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 
                7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled 
                in what would become the capital city 
                of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC.
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;
                Archaeological work has only discovered 
                evidence of Nabataean presence dating back 
                to the second century BC, by which time 
                Petra had become their capital. 
                The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in 
                Petra's proximity to the incense trade 
                routes by establishing it as a major 
                regional trading hub.

                &emsp;
                The trading business gained the Nabataeans 
                considerable revenue and Petra became 
                the focus of their wealth. 
                The Nabataeans 
                were accustomed to living in the barren 
                deserts, unlike their enemies, and were 
                able to repel attacks by taking advantage 
                of the area's mountainous terrain. 
                They were particularly skillful in harvesting
                rainwater, agriculture and stone carving. 
                Its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.

                Petra's importance declined as sea trade 
                routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 
                363 destroyed many structures. 
                In the Byzantine era several Christian churches 
                were built, but the city continued to 
                decline, and by the early Islamic era it was 
                abandoned except for a handful of nomads. 
                It remained unknown until it was redisc
                overed in 1812 by Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.
