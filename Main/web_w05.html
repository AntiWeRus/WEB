                The Taj Mahal ("Crown of the Palace") is 
                an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on
                the right bank of the river Yamuna in the
                Indian city of Agra.

            <p>

                It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal 
                emperor Shah Jahan (1628-1658) to house
                the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal;
                it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan
                himself. 
                The tomb is the centrepiece of
                a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which in
                cludes a mosque and a guest house, and is
                set in formal gardens bounded on three s
                ides by a crenellated wall.

                Construction of the mausoleum was essentially
                completed in 1643, but work continued
                on other phases of the project for another
                10 years. 
                The Taj Mahal complex is 
                believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653. 
                The construction project
                employed some 20,000 artisans under the 
                guidance of a board of architects led by the
                court architect to the emperor, Ustad 
                Ahmad Lahauri. 
                Various types of symbolism
                have been employed in the Taj to reflect
                natural beauty and divinity.

            <p>
                &emsp;
                The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO
                World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the
                jewel of Muslim art in India and one of 
                the universally admired masterpieces of
                the world's heritage". 
                It is regarded by 
                many as the best example of Mughal architecture
                and a symbol of India's rich history. 
                The Taj Mahal attracts more than 6
                million visitors a year.
