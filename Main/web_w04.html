                Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca 
                citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of 
                southern Peru on a 2,430-meter mountain ridge.

            <p>
                &emsp;
                The Incas, in contrast to the Maya, had no 
                written language, and no European visited 
                the site until the 19th century, so far 
                as is known. 
                There are, therefore, no written 
                records of the site while it was in use. 
                The names of the buildings, their
                supposed uses, and their inhabitants are
                all the product of modern archeologists,
                on the basis of physical evidence, 
                including tombs at the site.

                Most recent archaeologists believe that 
                Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate 
                for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438-1472).
                Often referred to as the "Lost City 
                of the Incas", it is the most familiar 
                icon of Inca civilization. 
                The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it 
                a century later, at the time of the Spanish conquest.

                &emsp;
                Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style,
                with polished dry-stone walls. 
                Its three primary structures are the 
                Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the 
                Room of the Three Windows. 
                Most of the 
                outlying buildings have been reconstructed
                in order to give visitors a better idea 
                of how they originally appeared. 
                By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored 
                and restoration continues.

                Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary
                in 1981 and a UNESCO World 
                Heritage Site in 1983. 
                In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonde
                rs of the World in a worldwide internet poll.
