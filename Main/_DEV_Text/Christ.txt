 1931. 
It is made of reinforced concrete
 and soapstone. 
The monument weighs 635 
metric ton.

Maintenance work needs to be conducted per
iodically because of the strong winds and
 erosion to which the statue is exposed, 
as well as lightning strikes. 
The origin
al pale stone is no longer available in s
ufficient quantity, and replacement stone
s are increasingly darker in hue.

world, the statue has also become a cultu
ral icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazi
l and was voted one of the New Seven Wond
ers of the World.

The Christ the Redeemer differs considerab
ly from its original design. 
The initial
 plan was a large Christ with a globe in 
one hand and a cross in the other. 
Altho
ugh the project organisers originally acc
epted the design, it later changed to the
 statue of today, with the arms spread ou
t wide.
