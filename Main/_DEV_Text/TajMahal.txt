The Taj Mahal ("Crown of the Palace") is a
n Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on
 the right bank of the river Yamuna in th
e Indian city of Agra.

It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal 
emperor Shah Jahan (1628-1658) to house t
he tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mah
al; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan
 himself. 
The tomb is the centrepiece of
 a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which in
cludes a mosque and a guest house, and is
 set in formal gardens bounded on three s
ides by a crenellated wall.

Construction of the mausoleum was essentia
lly completed in 1643, but work continued
 on other phases of the project for anoth
er 10 years. 
The Taj Mahal complex is be
lieved to have been completed in its enti
rety in 1653. 
The construction project e
mployed some 20,000 artisans under the gu
idance of a board of architects led by th
e court architect to the emperor, Ustad A
hmad Lahauri. 
Various types of symbolism
 have been employed in the Taj to reflect
 natural beauty and divinity.

The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO W
orld Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the
 jewel of Muslim art in India and one of 
the universally admired masterpieces of t
he world's heritage".

ecture and a symbol of India's rich histo
ry.

illion visitors a year. 


In 2007 it was declared a winner of the Ne
