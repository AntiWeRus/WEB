                The Great Wall of China is a series of
                fortifications that were built across the historical
                northern borders of ancient Chinese
                states and Imperial China as protection
                against various nomadic groups from the
                Eurasian Steppe.
            </p>  

            <p>
                &emsp;
                Several walls were built from as early as 
                the 7th century BC. Later, many Chinese 
                dynasties built and maintained multiple segments of border walls. 
                The best-known 
                sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (13681-644).
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;
                The defensive characteristics of the Great
                Wall were enhanced by the construction of
                watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison 
                stations, signaling capabilities through 
                the means of smoke or fire, and the fact 
                that the path of the Great Wall also 
                served as a transportation corridor.
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;
                Apart from defense, other purposes of the 
                Great Wall have included border controls, 
                allowing the imposition of duties on 
                goods transported along the Silk Road, 
                regulation or encouragement of trade and the 
                control of immigration and emigration.
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;
                Before the use of bricks, the Great Wall 
                was mainly built from rammed earth, stone, and wood. 
                During the Ming, however, 
                bricks were heavily used in many areas of 
                the wall, as were materials such as tiles, 
                lime, and stone. 
                The size and weight of 
                the bricks made them easier to work with
                than earth and stone, so construction quickened.
                Additionally, bricks could bear
                more weight and endure better than 
                rammed earth.
